```

If you execute the `/start` command, application will start.

```language-bash
enkan> /start /
```

## Scaffolding

`enkan-devel` is a useful tool in development. it contains the command to generate an application scaffold.

### Create table

```language-bash
enkan> /generate table PRODUCT (id identity primary key, name varchar(255))
```

If automatic building is unavailable, the `/compile` command is useful. 

```language-bash
enkan> /compile
```

When you reset your application, Flyway component will execute the generated migration. 

```language-bash
enkan> /reset
```

### Generate a CRUD controller and templates 

When you execute `/generate` command, a CRUD controller and templates will be generated.

```language-bash
enkan> /generate crud PRODUCT
```

If necessary, compile it.

```language-bash
enkan> /compile
```

When you reset your application, the generated routes are reloaded and become available. 

```language-bash
enkan> /reset
```
